        <p class="para">My favourite hobby is reading. I like reading novels which have thrill and adventure.I read it in my free time When I read it is like a moving film in my mind with all the voices,backgrounds...etc. It helps me to concentrate and helps me from being distracted. Reading has many advantages. This hobby can be developed by anyone. It is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge. Reading is like exercise for the brain. It also helps in improving our communication skills. The hobby of reading books are also encouraged by schools,doctors...etc.
